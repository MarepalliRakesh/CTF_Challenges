# Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges and SOC Analyst Badges

This repository showcases my experience in solving **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenges and the SOC Analyst badges I earned from LetsDefend. The challenges tested my skills in vulnerability exploitation, network enumeration, and incident response, while the badges represent my proficiency in key Security Operations Center (SOC) tasks such as malware analysis and threat detection.

## Hack The Box Challenges

### 1. **SMB Enumeration Challenge**
- **Description**: This challenge required me to enumerate SMB services running on a target machine, identifying open shares and potential misconfigurations that could be exploited.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - **Nmap** for port scanning and SMB enumeration.
  - **smbclient** for interacting with SMB shares.
- **Key Learning**: I learned how to effectively gather information from SMB services and identify vulnerable configurations that could expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access.

### 2. **Privilege Escalation Challenge**
- **Description**: In this challenge, after gaining initial access to a low-privileged user account, I needed to escalate my privileges to gain full control over the system.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **Linux privilege escalation scripts** like `linpeas` to automate the discovery of vulnerabilities.
  - **Exploit-DB** to find privilege escalation exploits for the kernel or installed software.
- **Key Learning**: This challenge helped me understand various privilege escalation techniques, including exploiting SUID binaries, misconfigurations, and outdated kernel vulnerabilities.

## LetsDefend SOC Analyst Badges

### 1. **SOC Analyst Level 1 Badge**
- **Description**: The SOC Analyst Level 1 badge signifies my ability to monitor security alerts, analyze incidents, and respond to common threats like malware infections and phishing attempts.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **SIEM** platforms for log analysis and threat hunting.
  - **Wireshark** for network traffic analysis.
  - **Splunk** for log correlation and incident monitoring.
- **Key Learning**: Through this training, I gained hands-on experience in triaging alerts, investigating incidents, and formulating response strategies to mitigate security risks.

### 2. **Malware Analysis Badge**
- **Description**: This badge represents my skills in analyzing malicious software and identifying its behavior and impact on infected systems. The focus was on reverse-engineering malware and extracting indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Tools Used**:
  - **IDA Pro** and **Ghidra** for reverse engineering malware.
  - **YARA** rules to detect malware patterns.
  - **VirusTotal** for scanning and analyzing suspicious files.
- **Key Learning**: This badge helped me understand the malware analysis process, from dynamic and static analysis to identifying payloads, backdoors, and communication channels used by malware.

## Skills Developed

Through these CTF challenges and SOC training, I developed the following core cybersecurity skills:

- **Vulnerability Exploitation**: Gained hands-on experience in exploiting misconfigurations, weak services, and software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Mastered various techniques for escalating privileges on compromised systems, including exploiting SUID binaries and kernel vulnerabilities.
- **Malware Analysis**: Acquired skills in reverse-engineering malware to understand its behavior, extract IOCs, and develop mitigation strategies.
- **Incident Response**: Learned how to analyze security incidents, respond to alerts, and use SIEM tools to monitor and protect network infrastructure.

## Tools Frequently Used:
- **Nmap** for network enumeration and vulnerability scanning.
- **Metasploit** for exploiting vulnerabilities and post-exploitation.
- **Burp Suite** for intercepting traffic and identifying web vulnerabilities.
- **Wireshark** for analyzing packet captures and understanding network traffic.
- **IDA Pro** and **Ghidra** for malware reverse engineering.
- **Splunk** for log analysis and incident management.
